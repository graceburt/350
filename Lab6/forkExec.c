// Lab 6 Task 4

// Modify forkExec.cso the child process image is replaced by the image of a program named child. 
// Use one of the execfamily of functions to do this.

// Write child.c to do the same thing as the child process did in Task 4. 
// The child should give its pid each time it prints the message. oThe parent should give its pid each time it prints the message. oThe childprogram should take three command-line arguments, the message, Nc, and Tc. 
// To get an interesting exit status from the child, have it return 37, rather than 0
